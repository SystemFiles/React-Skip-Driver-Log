# React-Skip-Driver-Log

As a student currently enrolled in my spring 2019 term, I thought I could do more than just go to school and go to work. This project was created as a solution to a problem I was facing in my part time gig at Skip The Dishes.

!! FULL DISCLOSURE: This is my FIRST ever app in React-Native so please let me know if you have any suggestions to improve my RN abilities. Thanks !!

## The Problem
Skip the dishes is a popular food delivery app that has become popular in the past couple of years as a flexible way to make a bit of cash while working another job or, in my purpose, during my studies. The first problem I noticed with skip is that there isn't a way in-app to actually see how much you are making and a detailed breakdown of how your pay is calculated.

## The Solution
While we can't directly access all the information on how pay is calculated and determine how much, exactly, we are really making. What we can do is keep a detailed record of every shift and use all of our data to arrive at a very accurate estimate of how much money we can make driving for SKip the Dishes with the cost of gas, wear & tear, plus other expenses such as tax expenditure per year etc.

With this app, I created a way to do exactly this. While the app is in very early stages, it currently features many of the abilities that would help drivers to determine if it is financially viable to drive for skip and also help to plan financial spending using income statistics that are accurate to your actualy working income.

## State of the App
Again, the app is in very early stages. The app does NOT work to fulfill ALL the requirements to solve the problem in its current state, but maybe if time permits in the future, there will be further development on this project to reach a production ready app that DOES fulfill all the requirements specified above.
